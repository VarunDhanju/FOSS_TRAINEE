## INCIDENT
About the my first interaction with a faculty (Chief Proctor)

Was playing volleyball in the court with a speaker at full volume. Well, I didnt know his house was just beside the volleyball area 🙂 . He came in , took a look around a went to the speaker , picked it up and started walking away. I thought it was a senior messing with me . I went to confront him , and just when I shouted " oh hello kaha ja rhe ho" (yes these are the exact words 😅). and than as I was approaching him , someone said "discipline incharge"🫠.
Maybe his mood was good , he let me with a warning , maybe bcoz I was a fresher .
